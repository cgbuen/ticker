# Twitch Ticker Overlay

A React web application (running on port 3001) of a Twitch overlay that
simulates an "ESPN Bottomline" ticker. It rotates through data that is retrieved
from an Express server running on port 3000.
([Here](https://github.com/cgbuen/chatbot) is the corresponding one that I use.)

## Install

I'm using node 8.16.0 and npm 5.10.0, but this is probably simple enough to work
with a lot of different versions.

    npm ci

## Run

    npm start
